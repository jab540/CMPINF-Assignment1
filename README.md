Members: Brian, Isaiah, Jared  

Assignment1.py performs a Caesar Shift encryption on the word the user types in. Doesn't work with spaces.  

Age.py determines when the user will be 18, how long ago he/she was 18, or if he/she is 18 right now.

Jaredtest is just Jared's test commit. We accepted the commit because we love him.
